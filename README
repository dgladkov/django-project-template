Example project to revisit Django project structure

Core ideas:
 * Apps placed in separate module.
 * Settings module with settings for each setup. No more settings_local!
 * Simple Makefile for routine tasks.
 * Base template with suggested block names.
 * Easy uWSGI setup.
 * Set of useful settings and third-party apps for development install
